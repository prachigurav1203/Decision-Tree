        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. In the context of classification, a Decision Tree is a tree-like structure that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets while gradually developing an associated decision tree. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes, where each leaf node represents a class label (output), and each decision node represents a feature-based test or condition.\n",

        " How a Decision Tree Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree uses a divide-and-conquer approach to classify data. It repeatedly splits the data based on certain features that best separate the classes. Here's how the process works step-by-step:\n",
        "\n",
        "Start with the entire dataset (Root Node):\n",
        "The algorithm starts with all data points at the root.\n",
        "\n",
        "Select the best feature to split the data:\n",
        "The model chooses the feature that results in the highest information gain or lowest impurity (depending on the chosen criterion, such as Entropy or Gini Index).\n",
        "\n",
        "Split the data into branches:\n",
        "The data is divided into groups based on the feature’s values.\n",
        "Each branch represents a possible decision or outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Create decision nodes and leaf nodes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Node: Represents a question or condition on a feature (e.g., “Is Age > 30?”).\n",
        "\n",
        "Leaf Node: Represents the final output class (e.g., “Yes” or “No”).\n",
        "\n",
        "Repeat recursively:\n",
        "The splitting process continues on each branch until one of the stopping conditions is met:\n",
        "\n",
        "All samples in a node belong to the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are no remaining features to split on.\n",
        "\n",
        "The maximum tree depth is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prediction:\n",
        "When predicting a new instance, the algorithm starts from the root node, follows the decisions down the tree based on feature values, and stops at a leaf node — the predicted class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you want to predict whether a person will buy a car based on two features: Age and Income.\n",
